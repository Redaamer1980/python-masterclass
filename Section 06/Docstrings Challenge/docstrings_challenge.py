"""
Section 6 Challenge - Docstrings
Create Docstrings for the three functions that we wrote, in the functions.py module.

Check your Docstrings by using Ctrl-Q (Ctrl-J on a Mac), to make sure they're formatted correctly,
and provide all the information someone would need, to use the functions.

Note: make sure you test your functions, after adding the Docstrings, to make sure you haven't broken anything.
